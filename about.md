Hi there! I'm Nathan, a seasoned principle engineer and application architect with over 15 years of experience in building data-driven applications that harness the power of machine learning and artificial intelligence.

Throughout my career, I've successfully delivered numerous high-impact projects that showcase the transformative potential of AI/ML. From developing an app that enables the EPA to model and visualize the impact of new construction and regulations on pollution to creating systems for petroleum companies to swiftly detect and address environmental concerns, I've demonstrated my ability to leverage cutting-edge technologies to solve real-world problems.

My passion for AI/ML began during my college days when I fell in love with the elegance of concepts like Bayes' theorem, Gaussian Processes, and Restricted Boltzmann Machines. Since then I've followed the field closely, doing data science as a profession before the term was even coined. This deep-rooted passion has driven me to continuously expand my knowledge and stay up-to-date with the latest advancements in the field. It has even extended into the creative realm, where I work extensively with image diffusion models to produce stunning art.

I started this site to help individuals and businesses navigate the exciting world of AI/ML and to make the process of building AI-powered tools clearer, saving you time and money. As a consultant, I offer my expertise to guide you through the complexities of AI/ML projects, ensuring that you achieve your goals efficiently and effectively. Whether you're looking to build a custom application or integrate AI/ML into your existing systems, I'm here to help.

If you're interested in building AI-powered applications, welcome and I you will find the content I produce worthy of regular return visits.  If you find what I do useful, I invite you to explore the APIs I publish, consider hiring me as a consultant for your project, or stay tuned for the groundbreaking personal discovery and self-improvement AI application I'm developing.
