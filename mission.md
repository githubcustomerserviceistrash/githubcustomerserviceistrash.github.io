Artificial intelligence is going to massively reshape society.  The challenge we as a species are faced with is how do we adapt and utilize this new power?  Humanity doesn't have a great track record of late - smart phones and social media have arguable destabilized society and made people unhappier.

AI doomers talk about skynet annihilating the human race, I think the true AI apocalypse is taking the ongoing algorithmic reduction of humanity to its ultimate final state, with people bomecoming soulless parts in a giant unfeeling system.  Many people believe late stage capitalism is getting dangerously close to that already, and AI will only turbocharge the process.  We're not too far gone though, with an upheaval like the one coming, there's still time to turn things around.

I am committed to using artificial intelligence to craft a new paradigm of user-centric applications designed to foster growth and personal development.  I want to set an example of what is possible that others can follow if they wish.  Applications shouldn't be designed to maximize engagement metrics, but rather to create gestalt experiences that aren't the sum of their A/B tests.
